One issue that we have found is waiting for <span class="caps">CSS </span>files to cache through.  Clearcache wont clear this but here is a way around it for Firefox only but you will be able to see the page upadated. 

In firebug simply find the css file in the header. <br />
<link media="screen, projection" type="text/css" href="http://currys2010.pan.e-merchant.com/css/themes/Delivery.css?staticVersion=1" rel="stylesheet">

and change the staticVersion number...Delivery.css?staticVersion=123

And there you go you can see the <span class="caps">CSS </span>file.  

Thanks

Tim
