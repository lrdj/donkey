A little confused by the implementations of permissions in <a href="http://movabletype.org/"><span class="caps">MT41</span></a> -- Are these 'permission tokens', fragments of data that exist independently of the user-object? I mean I get it that:

user + blog + role = permission

but how does this interface (or datastructure?) express nested permissions? Or in other words, shouldn't the "moderator" role for user = James be superceded by his "administrator" role? 

New stuff from <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">6A</a> is usually rock solid so I'm guessing there's a valid reason for the above...
